escalator
=========

An in-browser scala REPL which provides so far:

  - real time responses inline in the browser
  - syntax highlighting
  - autocompletion

To come: 
 
  - real time semantic highlighting in the browser
  - collaboration

This is work in progress and there are some severe security issues to solve before it can be provided online.
